1. the first thing when the page reloads we want to happen is to ask for video permission
2. The async keyword is used to indicate that this function contains asynchronous code that may involve waiting for some operations to complete.
3. This line is where the magic happens. It uses the navigator.mediaDevices.getUserMedia method to access the user's camera and microphone
The await keyword is used here to wait for the browser to complete this operation before moving on. When it's done, the result is stored in a variable called localStream.
4. document.getElementById('user-1'):

This part is like telling the web page to look for something with the ID "user-1" in the HTML code. When it finds it, it's like pointing at that specific part of the page.

.srcObject = localStream:
Once it has found the "user-1" part, it sets a property called srcObject of that part to localStream.
Think of it like telling the web page, "Hey, the video from the user's camera should be shown here in 'user-1'."

/*  
an SDP offer in WebRTC is like an invitation that one device sends to another when they want to start a video 
call or audio call over the internet. This invitation includes information about how the call should work, like 
the video and audio settings to use, and it's used to help both devices agree on how to communicate during the call.  

1. the 1st thing to do after this fn is to create a variable called peerconnection
now this variable will store all the info and also provides us methods to connect to that peer 
2. peerConnection = new RTCPeerConnection():

This line creates a connection between your device and another device over the internet. Think of it like setting up a phone line between you and the other person to talk 
3. remoteStream = new MediaStream():

This prepares a way to receive the other person's video and audio.
4. document.getElementById('user-2').srcObject = remoteStream:

This line is like telling your computer screen to be ready to show the other person's video in an area labeled 'user-2'.
5. let offer = await peerConnection.createOffer():

This is like you asking the other person, "Hey, how should we talk and share video?" You create a kind of plan (called an "offer") for how you want the call to work.
6. await peerConnection.setLocalDescription(offer):

After you make your plan (the offer), you share it with the other person and say, "This is how I want the call to be."
